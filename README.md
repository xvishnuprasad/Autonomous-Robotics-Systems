The code implements a simple behavior for a robot to follow a line using line sensors, avoid
obstacles using a sonic sensor, and control an LED based on sensor feedback.
• The logic suggests a basic navigation algorithm where the robot adjusts its motor powers and
LED status in response to the detected environment.
• Further enhancements and functionalities could be added based on the specific requirements of
the robot's task, such as additional sensor inputs or more complex decision-making algorithms.
